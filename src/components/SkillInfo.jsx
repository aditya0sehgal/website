      I have 3+ years of web development experience. I have many projects that
      show my work which can be found on my github. Along with that I am also
      inclined towards mobile application development. I have 3+ years of
      experience working in python too. Having done most of my college
      assignments, built a few projects and performed data analysis and mining
      tasks in python, I am pretty confident working with python.

      I hold certifications in React Basics and Advanced React, both of
      which are part of the prestigious Meta Front-End Developer Professional
      Certificate program. These certifications have equipped me with a deep
      understanding of React&apos;s core concepts and advanced features,
      enabling me to build dynamic and efficient web applications. The
      comprehensive training covered everything from fundamental principles to
      advanced techniques, ensuring I can create high-performance user
      interfaces and manage state effectively.
